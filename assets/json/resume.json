It features a detector array of more than 6000 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) and a cryogenic, scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) that covers the full spectral range of 210-420 GHz with a resolving power of R = 100"]},{"name":"Atacama Cosmology Telescope","position":"Site Engineer","startDate":"2019-10-22","endDate":"2021-07-31","summary":"CMB experiment managed by Princeton University (Princeton, NY)","highlights":["Ensured the continuous and smooth operation of all of the telescope's subsystems, such as a the cryogenic cooling system 90 mK.","Performed calibration procedures like the alignment of the receiver and the primary and secondary reflectors through high-precision photogrammetry.
